# Torah Gated Community

I'm an ASP.Net Core MVC/Razor/Blazor developer that also has passion for promoting the idea of what I call a **Torah Gated Community**,
so therefore I created [this website](https://www.torahgatedcommunity.com) as a place to park my ideas in support of this passion.

As a [Beit Din](https://livingmessiah.com/Leadership#JohnMarsing) elder of [Living Messiah Ministries](https://livingmessiah.com/) (LMM)
I was given the task of putting down on paper what a Torah Gated Community would look like for the benefit of LMM and their members.

### Torah Gated Community defined. 
> A physical place where Torah observant people can come together and live based on their **strongly held religious beliefs and convictions**
with an emphasis on **self reliance** and **self governance**.

- Self reliance would come about by living on a large section of land using **Permaculture** practices 
- Self governance would come about by taking on the duties and responsibilities that the church has delegated to the state.
